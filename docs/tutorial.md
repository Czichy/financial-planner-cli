# Tutorial
There are a couple use cases I figure this tool can be useful for.

- See growth of an asset over time
- Report when you will pay off a liability
- Create and compare alternative plans
- Track progress on a plan

I will update this document over time as I figure out the most useful ones.

If you have any ideas for this, please create an issue so we can discuss :smile:
